                <p>A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise<br>
                    one day for being so slow.<br>
                    "Do you ever get anywhere?"<br>
                    he asked with a mocking laugh.<br>
                    "Yes," replied the Tortoise,<br>
                     "and I get there sooner than you think.<br>
                    I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-1">
                <p>The Hare was much amused at the idea<br>
                    of running a race with the Tortoise,<br>
                    but for the fun of the thing he agreed.<br>
                    So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge,<br>
                    marked the distance and started the runners off.<br>
                    The Hare was soon far out of sight,</p>

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-1">
                <p>and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply<br>
                    how ridiculous it was for him<br>
                    to try a race with a Hare,<br>
                    he lay down beside the course to take<br>
                    a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.
                    The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily,<br>
                    and, after a time,passed</p>

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-1">
                <p> the place where the Hare was sleeping.<br>
                    But the Hare slept on very peacefully;<br>
                    and when at last he did wake up,<br>
                    the Tortoise was near the goal.<br>
                    The Hare now ran his swiftest,<br>
                    but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.</p>
